<h1 align=center> Webdev </h1>

*A command line tool for creating boilerplate files for web development.*

## Installation:

Open your terminal and enter
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kavinbharathii/webdev
```
This will clone the project to your local machine. Once the installation is complete, update the `webdev.bat` file by changing the file path given to the correct 
filepath of your local machine.

## Add to path:
After installation, open the **PATH** settings and update your `PATH` variable by adding the directory path to the `webdev` folder.

## Usage:

The `webdev` tool can be used by the following command
```bash
$ dev {project name}
```
This will create a folder with the project name and add the boilerplate files to the project. The files that'll be generated are,
- index.html
- style.css
- app.js
- README.md

Contributions are welcome!
